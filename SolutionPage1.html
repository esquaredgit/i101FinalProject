          <h3> Our Problem </h3>
          <p>  Farmers of a local county are creating and utilizing market stands as a way of
          reaching the public and selling produce. It has become increasingly difficult to let customers
          know where and when they will be set up and be open for business.

          <h3> Our Solution </h3>
          <p> In order to promote the goods and services offered at local farmers’ markets, and to facilitate interaction between the farmers and their customers, we are proposing a multi-faceted solution centered around a mobile application. This app would offer a variety of features for both farmers and customers that would result in greater information flow and customer engagement. To promote the use of the application, and to bring awareness to local producers, we are also proposing a social media-based ad campaign as a complementary solution. This type of marketing has gained popularity in recent years for a variety of reasons. One of the most obvious advantages to using Facebook advertisements is their ability to invite interaction from users. An advertisement on Facebook is not just displayed on a webpage, rather, it can be “liked,” shared, and commented on by its audience.  </p>

          <h3> The Target Market </h3>
          <p> Our target market is comprised of consumers who do and do not attend farmers markets. With the app, it will simply streamline the process of going to the market. Our social media advertising will help capture the people who maybe want to attend a local market, but don't know where to start or how to navigate one. </p>

          <h3> Will People Want It </h3>
          <p> Of everyone surveyed, we had an overwhelming percentage of people who are very likely or extremely likely to use the proposed app. </p>
