            <h3>Introduction of Problem </h3>
            <p>
                Farmers market needs advertise because no one is interested at farmers market.
            
                So we will make application to advertise there is farmers market and announce to the customer about products of farmers market.
                
                So we made survey for people and by the question, we meet the needs of the consumers, made an application.

            Farmers name is joe.
            He decided to sell his products  at farmers' market to get rid of the medium circulation.
            But people didn't come, so he couldn't sell his things.
            He thought advertise was a problem and he asked us to do it.
