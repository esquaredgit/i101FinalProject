            <h3>Introduction of Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Farmers market needs advertise because no one is interested at farmers market.

                So we will make application to advertise there is farmers market and announce to the customer about products of farmers market.

                So we made survey for people and by the question, we meet the needs of the consumers, made an application.

        <h3>Scenario of problem</h3>
            Farmers name is joe.
            He decided to sell his products  at farmers' market to get rid of the medium circulation.
            But people didn't come, so he couldn't sell his things.
            He thought advertise was a problem and he asked us to do it.

        <h3>Process of solution</h3>
        <p>
        In order to promote the goods and services offered at local farmers’ markets, and to facilitate interaction between the farmers and their customers, we are proposing a mutli-faceted solution centered around a mobile application. This app would offer a variety of features for both farmers and customers that would result in greater information flow and customer engagement. The following are some examples of the features offered by the app:

        <div class = "six columns">
        <p>Farmers/Producers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Farmers can push out notifications to customers who follow their booth on the app. </li>
            <li>Farmers can keep track of inventory sold, and the app would use predictive analytics to let them know what customers like/don’t like.</li>
            <li>The app can keep profile data for each user and push products/producers that users might like, but haven’t favorited yet.</li>
            <li>The app uses machine learning/predictive techniques to let farmers know what types of products would be more successful at certain locations.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class = "six columns">
        <p>Customers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users can favorite certain booths/producers, products, etc. and get notified when these favorites are present in their area (using geofencing, for example).</li>
            <li>Users can search by booth/producer, product.</li>
            <li>Page that shows daily happenings related to farmers’ markets in the area.</li>
            <li>We could also implement an incentive system that would allow users to check in at individual booths and receive loyalty points of some sort, redeemable for a discount or something else of the farmer’s choice.</li>
