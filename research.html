        <h3> Source 1: A Research on Effectiveness of Facebook Advertising on Enhancing Purchase Intention of Consumers </h3>
        <p> In this research study, Milad Dehghani and Mustafa Turner summarize the effects that Facebook advertising can have on the brand image and customer engagement of a business. This article is particularly relevant today, as more and more companies are allocating a large percentage of their marketing budgets to social media-based strategies. This type of marketing has gained popularity in recent years for a variety of reasons. One of the most obvious advantages to using Facebook advertisements is their ability to invite interaction from users. An advertisement on Facebook is not just displayed on a webpage, rather, it can be “liked,” shared, and commented on by its audience. </p>
        <p> In this study, Dehghani and Turner found that the more interaction that these advertisements have, the more likely users are to increase their buying intention and share the advertisement by “word of mouth” in both virtual and physical interactions (Dehghani, Section 2). According to the study, this form of “interactive advertising” is more likely to positively affect a brand’s image, build unique brand awareness, and reach younger, social media-oriented audiences. These advantages, alongside lower costs to marketers than other forms of physical advertisements, make Facebook marketing ideal for local businesses or marketers with small budgets. </p>
        <p>	For this reason, Facebook advertising would be an extremely useful tool for the clients we are serving. The local producers that sell their products at farmers’ markets perfectly fit the profile for those vendors looking to expand their marketing strategies on Facebook. The low costs compared to traditional marketing methods will fit well within the small budgets of local producers. Furthermore, Dehghani and Turner’s research suggests that the type of “interactive marketing” created by Facebook makes customers more likely to continue to engage with a brand if an advertisement offers incentives to the customers (Dehghani, Conc.). By offering discounts on products, exclusive information from producers, and more via our advertisements, this strategy will likely push customers toward our mobile application in addition to the producers themselves.

      <h3> Source 2: Establishing and Operating a Community Farmers’ Market </h3>
        <p> Establishing and Operating a Community Farmers’ Market, by Forrest Stegelin, teaches community leaders and farmers the best ways to establish and manage a local farmers’ market.  The article begins by giving a proposed timeline of what happens each month of the year and what you should be doing during these periods to keep engagement with the community. Stegelin, talks about sponsorships and who should be involved.  For example, sponsorship with local fairgrounds or community organizations will be great publicity for the market. Also, when pertaining to who should be involved, Stegelin lists that county or city officials would provide “site, funding, policing, and staffing,” as well as police representatives can offer security. There are many opportunities and advantages for a Farmers Market, if you can get the local community involved.</p>
        <p> When focusing on customers, you need to be prepared to consistently meet their needs by having preset dates and times the market will be open. After completing a study on “Why customers shop at Farmers Markets,” the top three reasons include, 46% of customers want fresher and better-quality produce, 14% want cheaper prices, and 13% want a larger quantity. Pricing and quality are major factors, since you need to “establish a fair price and stick with it.” Lastly, consistently selling quality foods and produce, always exhibiting friendly and interested manners, partaking in accommodating and supportive policies for sellers, and having a wholesome variety will present sellers with success in a farmers’ market (Stegelin). </p>
        <p> This research relates to our solution strategies directly. Where, we plan to sell fresh and quality produce at a reasonable price. So many people go to grocery stores like Whole Foods, and, in Bloomington specifically, Fresh Thyme where although their quality is good, the prices are incredibly high. When shopping at the Farmers Market we guarantee reasonable prices, locally sourced foods, and fresh quality. Which according to the article, is what customers are seeking. Lastly, we plan to pair with the local community to increase publicity and gain access to community benefits. </p>

      <h3> Source 3: 6 proven ways of engaging your app users </h3>
      <p>  “6 Proven Ways of Engaging Your App Users” by Inapptics details six key points that are necessary in providing quality user experience and retention. Getting people to download your app isn’t as difficult as getting them to continually use it. Mobile app usage time far exceeds web time on smartphones, so apps need to be well made to retain users. The suggested ways to increase user satisfaction range from the speed of the app, to utilizing push notifications and using behavioral analytics. Creating an app that is convenient, easy to use, and intuitive leads to better user experience, and in turn, user retention. An app is useless if it is downloaded by a significant amount of people who then stop using it within the first few days or weeks (6 proven ways of engaging your app users). </p>
      <p>  A key component of our solution utilizes an app that consumers can use for shopping at farmers markets. Apps are an effective way to convey information quickly and cleanly in a convenient form. Our app will be able to help farmers and customers promote goods and services and facilitate interaction. However, a poorly designed app will fail considerably. </p>
      <p> With our solution, we need an app that people will use again and again. It needs to create a positive user experience so we can retain those users. This article serves as a good basis for certain foundational blocks that we need to consider if our application is to be continually used. With returning users, we can help farmers reach consumers, make markets more efficient, and connect communities. </p>

      <h3> Source 4 (ACM): Chutney and Relish: Designing to Augment the Experience of Shopping at a Farmers' Market </h3>
      <p> In Designing to Augment the Experience of Shopping at a Farmers’ Market, Ann Light and Wakeman describe how Augmented Reality can advance the engagement of shoppers and producers at a farmers’ market. There are many factors that enhance a shopper’s experience, and by using AR it illustrates and finds new and trusted information. This journal in particular uses AR at a farmers marked “to determine the trustworthiness of particular stalls and sellers through provisions of a ratings and comment mechanism” (Light, Wakeman). </p>
      <p> Farmers Markets provide the same atmosphere as grocery stores years ago. Where there is a direct exchange between customer and the farm the product came from; this includes opportunities to see benefits to the famers and local economy, fresh and quality produce, and social networking. The AR device when pointed at a large symbol presented the data from the web server. The AR system allowed comments, showed previous comments, rankings (Light, Wakeman). </p>
      <p> This experiment of incorporating Augmented Reality into the atmosphere of a farmers market pertains to our solution strategies. This is because by adding an AR feature into the app we are creating it can give us data on what people are enjoying and disliking about the market. Also, it creates trust in produce, stallholders, and other shoppers. AR also allows people to know what is being offered and where they can find stallholders. Overall, AR can be very useful in the sense that it creates traits of tasting, feeling, and trusting the produce.
